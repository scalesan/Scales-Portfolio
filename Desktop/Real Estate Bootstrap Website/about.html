		I have been a Real Estate Professional for over 15 years and have witnessed drastic changes in the industry in this time. One thing for certain is this is definitely a field that is not cut out for everybody. It takes patience, understanding, reliability, and endurance to become a top producer. I have never been an agent that follows the crowd and seeks protection from big name companies. I am more concerned with being innovative and building my own brand. My top priority is educating my clients as it removes the stress from the process. I have many accomplishments to be proud of but my commitment to giving back sets the bar high for those who dare to compete.

		I have been a member of BITL(Believe in the Light) Organization for more than two years. As part of this group, I assist in feeding 100-200 homeless Detroiters every sunday throughout all four seasons. 
	</p>
  <p class="aboutParagraph" id="aboutLastParagraph">Some of the other organizations that I have been apart of include Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, Volunteers of America, and Y.A.R.D. (Youth at Risk Detroit), which I founded in 2018. My aim with Y.A.R.D. is to address youth violence, domestic abuse, and mass incarceration. This is accomplished by engaging in open forums to start the discussion of violence and healing.  </p>
